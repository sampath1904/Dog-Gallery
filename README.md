# Dog-s-Gallery
The Dog’s Gallery website is a front-end application designed for dog enthusiasts to explore and enjoy images of various dog breeds. Built with a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site allows users to search for a specific breed from a dropdown menu labeled "Dog Breed." After selecting a breed, clicking the "Get Image" button displays an image of the chosen dog in the central container of the page. If users want to explore more images of the same breed, they can click the "Next" button, located conveniently in the center-right section of the page. Each click dynamically fetches and displays a new image, offering a seamless browsing experience.

For those looking to view multiple images at once, the "Gallery" button at the top-right corner provides an extended feature. Upon clicking this button, the page displays a collection of images related to the selected breed, enhancing the user's exploration and enjoyment. The website leverages the efficiency of JavaScript to handle image fetching and dynamic updates, ensuring quick response times. 

The site’s layout is intuitive, with clear visual distinctions between buttons and functional areas, ensuring accessibility for all users. Responsive design principles have been implemented, making the site equally appealing on mobile devices and desktops. The combination of interactive features and smooth navigation makes Dog’s Gallery a delightful experience for dog lovers, showcasing the versatility of modern front-end web development techniques.
